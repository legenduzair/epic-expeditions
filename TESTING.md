### Integration Testing

The integration testing method via test cases was used when developing code for a specific feature of the project. This helped with finding errors and defects early during development to minimise problems with functionality of the website. The test cases were separated into different sections via ID's.

## Validation Testing

### HTML Validation

To validate the templates written in HTML for this project, I had to copy the code rendered on Google Chrome's page source option and paste it into the validator. This is because Django templates contain Jinja syntax in them which means it is not possible to directly copy the code from the templates. Any following screenshots are of HTML templates validated via [Nu HTML Checker](https://validator.w3.org/nu/), which contained any errors/warnings.

![All Pages HTML Check](/media/testing/htmlcheck-ss.png)

After running the HTML code of all templates of this project, there were no errors found within the actual code. However the validator presented with four warnings. These warnings are related to the type attribute located in the four script tags which are optional to include.

### CSS Validation

My custom CSS stylesheet was validated using [The W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). The report returned with no errors. The warnings found are related to custom vendor prefixes. 

![CSS Validator Check](/media/testing/csscheck-ss.png)

### JavaScript Validation

Both custom JavaScript files were validated using [JS Hint](https://jshint.com/). Both reports returned with no errors. 

![JS Hint check one](/media/testing/jscheckone-ss.png)

![JS Hint check two](/media/testing/jschecktwo-ss.png)

### Python Validation

All Python code developed in this project was validated using [PEP8 Online Check](http://pep8online.com/). The only error that was reported by the Python Validator was on the models.py file for the Reviews app. This error is linked to the cloudinary field attribute being longer than 79 characters due to the placeholder URL. The settings.py file contains five 'longer than 79 characters' errors. This is due to the Django default code pointing to password validation paths or from Cloudinary code pointing to the cloudinary storage service, thus cannot be prevented. Screenshots of all validation reports are listed below:
