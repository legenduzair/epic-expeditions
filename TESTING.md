# <div align="center">Testing</div>

During and after the development of Epic Expeditions, the project went through rigorous testing to ensure a fully functional and responsive website was created. I have documented all the testing techniques used in the following sections.

## Automated Testing

## Manual Testing

### Integration Testing

The integration testing method via test cases was used when developing code for a specific feature of the project. This helped with finding errors and defects early during development to minimise problems with functionality of the website. The test cases were separated into different sections via ID's.

## Validation Testing

### HTML Validation

To validate the templates written in HTML for this project, I had to copy the code rendered on Google Chrome's page source option and paste it into the validator. This is because Django templates contain Jinja syntax in them which means it is not possible to directly copy the code from the templates. Any following screenshots are of HTML templates validated via [Nu HTML Checker](https://validator.w3.org/nu/), which contained any errors/warnings.

![All Pages HTML Check](/media/testing/htmlcheck-ss.png)

After running the HTML code of all templates of this project, there were no errors found within the actual code. However the validator presented with four warnings. These warnings are related to the type attribute located in the four script tags which are optional to include.

### CSS Validation

My custom CSS stylesheet was validated using [The W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). The report returned with no errors. The warnings found are related to custom vendor prefixes. 

![CSS Validator Check](/media/testing/csscheck-ss.png)

### JavaScript Validation

Both custom JavaScript files were validated using [JS Hint](https://jshint.com/). Both reports returned with no errors. 

![JS Hint check one](/media/testing/jscheckone-ss.png)

![JS Hint check two](/media/testing/jschecktwo-ss.png)

### Python Validation

All Python code developed in this project was validated using [PEP8 Online Check](http://pep8online.com/). The only error that was reported by the Python Validator was on the models.py file for the Reviews app. This error is linked to the cloudinary field attribute being longer than 79 characters due to the placeholder URL. The settings.py file contains five 'longer than 79 characters' errors. This is due to the Django default code pointing to password validation paths or from Cloudinary code pointing to the cloudinary storage service, thus cannot be prevented. Screenshots of all validation reports are listed below:

## Accessibility Testing

All accessibility testing for this project was carried out using Lighthouse, WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool) and WCAG Contrast Checker. On all three accesbility evaluation tools, the same problems were returned. These issues were linked to the button text not having enough contrast with the background of the button, which applied to all of the buttons throughout the website. This was solved by editing the text colour of the buttons. All accessbility testing screenshots are documented below.

### Lighthouse Evaluation

As the project was tested using Lighthouse after deployment on Heroku, the performance scores are lower than it should be due to the delay of website rendering. On some pages, the performance scores are high as the speed of loading up the deployed website varies. Any reductions in best practices & SEO is due to not having a robot.txt file in my project and having an error linked to cookies.

#### Home Page - Mobile

#### Expedition Review List - Desktop

This HTML template had an issue with contrast of the review card content. To resolve this, I increased the font size and darkened the color of the text on the review card.

## Bugs and Fixes

The following section consists of many bugs that were encountered and fixed during the development of this project. 

- Bug No 1
  - Issue: When uploading an image on the 'Add Review' page and selecting the Add Review button to post it, the image would not display on the expeditions review card.
  - Cause: This was because to upload a file, a specific type of request is needed in the views.py file to handle that situation.
  - Fix: I added 'request.FILES' in the 'Add Review' view in views.py file. I also added an 'enctype' attribute to the add review HTML form which is needed for forms which contain file uploads.
- Bug No 2
  - Issue: When initially testing the comments section, any comment that I wrote was not posting to the comments. A 'null value in column violates not-null contraint' error was appearing.
  - Cause: This appeared because I had accidentally inserted 'new_comment.expedition = expedition' in the review_detail view in views.py file. The '.expedition' was not doing anything.
  - Fix: I changed the 'new_comment.expedition' to 'new_comment.post' to allow Django to post comments.
- Bug No 3
  - Issue: When registering for an account on the website, I encountered a 'ConnectionRefusedError' after entering an email address.
  - Cause: This was due to non-existent backend attributes in the settings.py file for email authentication.
  - Fix: I inserted email backends into the settings.py file; "EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'".
- Bug No 4
  - Issue: After posting an expedition review to the review list, the author of the user (username) was not displaying properly in the card footer. 
  - Cause: This was due to the author field from models.py file not being mentioned in the views.py file, in the add_review view. 
  - Fix: I added 'data.author = request.user' which allowed my Django project to relate to the username that was posting the expedition review.
- Bug No 5
  - Issue: The browser would keep refreshing after entering credentials in the sign in and registration allauth forms, preventing authentication.
  - Cause: This was due to amending the allauth HTML templates when customising the forms by adding bootstrap content.
  - Fix: I re-added the Jinja syntax 'form_as_p' in both login and signup HTML templates.
- Bug No 6
  - Issue: When developing the Delete Review confirmation page, I faced problems with deleting the review from the database after selecting the 'Delete Review' button.
  - Cause: This was due to a delete review form and POST request not being present in the HTML & views.py files.
  - Fix: I added a POST form to the delete_review html template and a POST request to the delete_review view in views.py file. This allowed for the chosen review to be deleted.
- Bug No 7
  - Issue: When searching for a city that has a space in between such as 'New York' or 'Cape Town' in the weather app, it would throw a Django error.
  - Cause: This is because the api URL requested cannot contain whitespaces. 
  - Fix: I used the .replace python feature to replace any whitespace in a city's name with '%20'. This is commonly used in URLs that query strings with whitespaces.
- Bug No 8
  - Issue: Encountered a script error on Google Chrome's Developer Tools when I was on every HTML page except the 'add_review.html' template. This script error was referencing the target event listener used to implement star ratings. As a result, this affected lighthouse accessbility ratings.
  - Cause: The script tag that reference the 'script.js' file was loaded in the 'base.html' template.
  - Fix: I removed the script tag from the 'base.html' template and only added in the 'add_review.html' template.
- Bug No 9
  - Issue: When inputting the edit_review view URL directly in the search bar along with an expedition ID, any user could access that review without authentication. 
  - Cause: The '@login_required' library was not inputted before the edit_review view in 'views.py' file.
  - Fix: I inserted '@login_required' before the function-based views in 'views.py' file of the reviews app.
