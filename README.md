## Project Overview
Epic Expeditions is a web application that allows the target audience to browse & create reviews of global destinations and engage in conversations with other users who are also authenticated on the website. Epic Expeditions also offers a mini weather application that allows users to search for current weather conditions of any city worldwide.

This project was implemented with the purpose of developing a full-stack Django application with use of Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JavaScript & Python as the programming tools used. It utilises CRUD functionality that allows authenticated users to create, browse, update and delete expedition reviews to the website. The weather application is implemented using [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/). The allauth Django library is used to implement registration and signing in of users.

## UX & Planning

## Project Strategy
  
### Project Goal
  - The goal of this project is to create a platform that allows users to share their experiences of expeditions they have been on around the world and evaluating them. A secondary goal for the project is that users can have the ability to check live weather updates of their favourite expeditions they have been on by searching for a city.

### Target Audience
  - Users who love to go travelling.
  - Users who love to share their thoughts on places they have visited with others.
  - Users who want to gain an insight of places around the world before they go themselves.

## Project Scope

### Site Owner Goals
  - Build a platform that is easy to navigate and has an intuitive user interface.
  - Website developed must be visually appealing on all screen sizes.
  - Build a platform that is user-friendly and is accessible to all.

### Entity Relationship Diagram
  - As this project utilises Django which is a MVT(Model, View & Template) framework, a connection to database tabels or 'Models' is required. An entity relationship diagram was created to visually map out the structure of the databases & models. The entity relationship diagram is mapped out below. 

  #### Reviews App

  | ----- | ----- |
  | Review Title | CharField |
  | Slug | SlugField |
  | Author | ForeignKey |

### Agile Methodology - User Stories
  - All forms of agile methodology were managed using GitHub Issues through implementing user stories gaining potential perspectives of a target user.

## Project Structure
  - Epic expeditions uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript & Python to create a user-friendly and intuitive web application. This project focuses on using Django/Jinja syntax to structure the code to make it more cleaner and readable during the development stage. This web application is aimed to contain a responsive and user-friendly layout so it can be accessible across different browsers & devices of various screen sizes. 
  - The navbar is placed at the top of the webpage in a fixed position with navigation links displayed to the user to access different pages of the site. On smaller screen sizes, the navbar is converted into a hamburger menu to allow users to access the navigation links with ease.
  - The expedition reviews are structured in card-containers which are all the same height and width to keep consistency. Eight reviews are paginated on one webpage and if more reviews are added, the user will have an option to redirect onto the next page.
  - Each expedition review can be clicked on to access special actions such as liking and commenting, which only authenticated users can perform.
  - Users can be authenticated by click on the 'register' and 'sign in' navigation links which redirects them to a form.
  - The CRUD functionality is also incorporated into the project structure as authenticated users can add, update & delete their expedition reviews.
  - The weather app is implemented into the project, where users can search for weather details of their favourite cities worldwide. Performing a search will result in a weather card with these details stated, structured beneath the search bar.   

## Project Skeleton

### Wireframes
  - Before initiating the project, I planned the general layout and structure of the main content for each page of the website across various screen sizes; desktop, tablet and mobile. The wireframes below were designed using Balsamiq Wireframes:
    - [Landing Page](https://github.com/legenduzair/epic-expeditions/blob/main/media/wireframes/landingpage-wf.png)
    - [Reviews Page](https://github.com/legenduzair/epic-expeditions/blob/main/media/wireframes/reviewpage-wf.png)
    - [Full Review Page](https://github.com/legenduzair/epic-expeditions/blob/main/media/wireframes/fullreview-wf.png)
    - [Add Review Page](https://github.com/legenduzair/epic-expeditions/blob/main/media/wireframes/addreview-wf.png)
    - [Register Page](https://github.com/legenduzair/epic-expeditions/blob/main/media/wireframes/registerpage-wf.png)
    - [Login Page](https://github.com/legenduzair/epic-expeditions/blob/main/media/wireframes/loginpage-wf.png)
    - [Weather App Page](https://github.com/legenduzair/epic-expeditions/blob/main/media/wireframes/weatherpage-wf.png)

## Surface Design

### Colour Scheme
After completing the layout of the wireframes to create a skeleton for the project, I selected the colour scheme by generating a colour palette on [Coolors](https://coolors.co/). The colours from the palette were used as they had high level of colour contrast to maximise user accessibility. The colour palette is shown below. 

![Colour Palette generated on Coolors](/media/screenshots/color_scheme.png)

The colours implemented in the navbar and weather search bar were generated using a gradient on [CSS Gradient](https://cssgradient.io/).

### Typography
When designing the website, I had carefully chosen two complimentary fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/); 'Quicksand' and 'Source Sans Pro'. It is important that the text on the website is clear & easy for users to read and is not too unappealing to the human eye. The letters are spaced out correctly and the style of the font fits the scheme of the website; Travelling.

### Images
All images used for developing the website are acquired from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/images/stock/royalty-free). Images used to add test expedition reviews were acquired from my file explorer on my personal computer.

### Icons
The main logo of the website and two weather icons (humidity and wind speed) were acquired from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). The pressure weather icon was acquired from [Flat Icon](https://www.flaticon.com/).

## Features

### Home Page
The home page aims to welcome the user to Epic Expeditions with a welcome message and slogan underneath. There is also an interactive button that navigates the user to the expeditions review list page to allow them to browse what is already posted by other users. The background image of the home page is vibrant to provide the user with a happy vibe when first glancing at the website.

### Navigation Header
The main navigation bar is located at the top of the webpage, displaying name of the website with a logo and navigation links that the user would require. 
![Main Navbar](/media/screenshots/navbar-ss.png)

If the user is authenticated on the website, a secondary user menu is available that display the 'Add Review' and 'Logout' navigation links instead of 'Register' and 'Sign In'. 
![Secondary Navbar](/media/screenshots/navbartwo-ss.png)

The navigation bar is fully responsive and adapts to devices with medium/smaller screen sizes by adding a hamburger menu. This hamburger icon can be selected to bring up a user menu that drops down below.
